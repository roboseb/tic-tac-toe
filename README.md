	Yeesh. Was a lot of work to wrap my head around the relatively simple concepts of factory functions and modules, but once I got it the base game of tic tac toe was fairly simple, and was done in a day. On day two I started adding computer functions for playing intelligently instead of just randomly, and got a basic system for blocking a winning play and playing a win done quickly. I then had the big idea to make the AI unbeatable, as the Odin Project suggested, and though it seemed like a reasonable challenge. First started by manually coding possible game states and their recommended respones for the AI, then quickly realized there were far too many. (This may have been obvious to most.) I then did some research in to what other people have done to make this possible, and found it to be pretty complicated. Ended up copying someone else's code over to mine and fixing all the variables as well as my own functions to match. Of course the resulting code is an absolute mess, as this was my first time implementing such a solution. Also my first time touching recursion, but I will have to do something else with recursion where I actually write the program from scratch.

	Yeesh again. Basically, before the first devlog, I had about three or four days of not working on this project because my friend introduced me to a game called Across the Obelisk. Great game. Played it like a full-time job for a couple weeks, got all the achievements. I started working on this a little while I was still playing it, but those first few days were rough. Got back to this, did a bunch of work, and then I got pretty sick, and couldn't work on this for almost a week. Sucks. Anyway, now it's done. And it does more or less everything I envisioned. Time to move on. Also I could've sworn I planned to alternate between quickly finishing projects and making more complicated ones. Didn't happen. Longest project by far, around 37 hours or so including the art and everything. Again, seeing the number makes me feel like it's not as impressive as it could be. It's still pretty cool and fun to play around with.
