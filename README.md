	Yeesh. Was a lot of work to wrap my head around the relatively simple concepts of factory functions and modules, but once I got it the base game of tic tac toe was fairly simple, and was done in a day. On day two I started adding computer functions for playing intelligently instead of just randomly, and got a basic system for blocking a winning play and playing a win done quickly. I then had the big idea to make the AI unbeatable, as the Odin Project suggested, and though it seemed like a reasonable challenge. First started by manually coding possible game states and their recommended respones for the AI, then quickly realized there were far too many. (This may have been obvious to most.) I then did some research in to what other people have done to make this possible, and found it to be pretty complicated. Ended up copying someone else's code over to mine and fixing all the variables as well as my own functions to match. Of course the resulting code is an absolute mess, as this was my first time implementing such a solution. Also my first time touching recursion, but I will have to do something else with recursion where I actually write the program from scratch.
