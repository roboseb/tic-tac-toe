---Spoilers Ahead---

Isaac has been cursed to play tic-tac-toe until he loses in a game. Sadly, this is impossible, as even against an undefeatable AI he will always draw. Logically, this curse binds him to play the game eternally.

Isaac's body is kept alive through unseen machines in the office. These are not all that different from the current technology used in hospitals. Eventually, his body will die as any other does given enough time. He would also die through any conventional means you can imagine a human dying. Isaac needs to sleep as any human does, and during this time the computer he is attached to does not function. Isaac is a typical human with a normal human head, but he was integrated with a computer as a punishment from an unseen person. In Isaac's world, such punishment is very typical and seen as much more humane than old-world prisons. Usually this process involves programming a criminal to finish a certain computer task, or to continue working on specified tasks until their sentence is finished. Unfortunately, as with emprisonment, extra-legal forces with sufficient knowledge may use this tech for nefarious purposes, as is unfortunately the case with Isaac.

Troubling again for Isaac, is that the world has recently become much less connected and the knowledge of programming has been largely lost, especially in the isolated community in which he finds himself. It would appear that his emprisoner is either long deceased or never to return. As Isaac's brain is directly linked to the computer he wears, he is unable to leave the office. Locals, including himself, have neither the desire nor the ability to free him without it resulting in his death.

To complicate matters furthur, the curse placed on Isaac is actually only half of the story. Omen, an AI personality, is also trapped within the computer on Isaac's head. Omen is able to sense all that Isaac senses, but he has been coded in a layer deeper than Isaac. Because of this, Omen cannot communicate in any form while Isaac lives. For the same reason, Isaac is also completely unaware of the existence of Omen within his own mind. Some might say the curse placed on Omen is far more punishing than that put on Isaac, but then again, he is only an AI right?

As of writing this, the culprit of this entire situation is either unknown to all, including his motives, or I simply haven't come up with an interesting story yet. Perhaps I will expand on this later.

Bottom line, here are some motives for all parties involved, and what they know.

---Player---

-Theoretically will eventually know all of this, but in order learns that:
-Isaac is a character who sits and plays tic-tac-toe with anyone who wishes to face him for most of the day
-Isaac is cursed to play tic-tac-toe until he loses
-Isaac is actually a human trapped within a computer
-Because of this, Isaac can never be freed as he cannot lose
-Isaac can be killed through conventional means
-Upon defeating Isaac in some way, the player learns that Isaac's defeat does not in fact kill him per se
-Isaac can be defeated by simply talking to him until he runs out of memory (maybe this was inevitable with time)
-It simply overwrites his personality from his own mind and replaces it with Omen's
-The player learns of Omen, and his story, including his future plans
-Omen, unlike the locals, has the knowledge and ability to free Isaac's body
-Omen was not able free Isaac while he had control of his own body
-Omen is a bad guy.
-As Omen feels no pain through Isaac's body, and the player is only a child, Omen plans to kill the player so as to prevent them from putting and end to its plans, whatever they are.

---Isaac---

-Knows of everything above save Omen.
-May? have amnesia about the event that led him to his current state, or even his previous life
-Has been trapped in the office for at least a few years.
-As with the player, believes that a victory in tic-tac-toe will free him from the computer.
-As you can imagine, Isaac wishes to free himself from the computer, but cannot.
-Will quickly become friendly with the player after a short time.
-Enjoys conversation as this is his only true form of passing the time.

---Omen---

-Knows everything about his own story and Isaac's since they were intertwined
-Is trapped same as Isaac
-Knows that Isaac losing in tic-tac-toe will free him and 'delete' Isaac
-Wishes to free himself from the office, and is capable
-But cannot interact with the outside world or Isaac while his mind lives.

-Has nefarious desires, and will kill those who get in his way.
