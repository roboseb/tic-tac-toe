There is a tic-tac-toe computer made exclusively of tinkertoys that uses much of the same logic I do. And yet I am undefeated.

I often have visitors. Those who deign to grace me with their presence tend to be children, and last autumn one such child sat in your place.

My lenses have gradually faded with the passing years, yet Her bright auburn-tinted mane was unmistakable.

She was to young to provide any true threat to my confinement. Despite this, She would return like clockwork to challenge me.

The Auburn-haired girl would recount to me her day while we played. She told me of Her mother, Her adoptive father, and Her lack of siblings.

Despite my curse, the office in which we sit provides me with all vital nourishment. She, of course, was not so lucky.

In the hopes of finding a better life after the passing of Her biological father, Her mother soon remarried.

Initially life was good. Her parents were both caring and the Auburn-haired girl's new father worked profitably as a skilled carpenter.

Then, the accident. A shout, a scream, a snap, and a collapse. The details were sparse, and yet the image was clear.

Bonds were increasingly strained within the household. Funds became the primary source of regular arguments, with Her as the inevitable victim.

The majority of my past remains a hazy memory, but upon Her revelation of this, a faint recollection sharpened in clarity.

I too, was a father. I also sensed that I could relate to the father in Her story. But to what extent?

Could this be related to my current status, trapped in the bowels of this crumbling edifice? 01001001 00100000 01100110 01100101 01100001 01$//;:{
